- The O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University was established to respond to the need for innovative solutions to the most pressing national and international health concerns.
- As a scholar with the Global Health Policy & Politics Initiative, I use my expertise in social epidemiology to equip activists with data to support their health advocacy.
