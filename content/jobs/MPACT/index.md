- MPACT was founded in 2006 as The Global Forum on MSM & HIV (MSMGF) by an international group of activists who were concerned about the disproportionate HIV burden being shouldered by gay and bisexual men.
- As a member of the team I managed a technical support program that supported community-based
  organizations in Kenya and Zimbabwe. Advised various public health programs in Africa on HIV. I also represented MPACT at various international venues whose goal was to improve health programs for gay men and other men who have sex with men.
