PhD candidate in social network epidemiology at Harvard University. 

I'm currently fascinated with human relationships and how they shape population health. I came through a winding road, starting in LGBT anti-violence organizing in Cape Town, through survey research on health and human rights in Oakland, HIV policy advocacy in Geneva, and HIV programs in Johannesburg. 

At the heart of all this work is the fact that people's health depends on their relationships with other people.

In my dissertation research, I focus on how family relationships shape health across large populations in South Africa. This theme complicates classical approaches to quantitative research, which tend to treat people as if they were independent from one another. 

I assume the opposite and adapt and apply cutting-edge causal inference methods to answer this question: how do the resources of one person affect the health of another?
