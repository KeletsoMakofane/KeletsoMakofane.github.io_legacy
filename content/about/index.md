PhD candidate in social network epidemiology at Harvard University.

I'm fascinated with how human relationships shape population health. I came to this focus through different experiences: LGBT anti-violence organizing in Cape Town, survey research on health and human rights in Oakland, HIV policy advocacy in Geneva, and HIV programs for men who have sex with men in Johannesburg. At the heart of this work is the idea that people's health depends on their relationships with other people. These relationships provide or withhold love and support and, importantly, food, shelter and help.

In my dissertation research, I investigate the impact of family relationships on health across large communities in South Africa. This theme eludes classical approaches to causal inference, which tend to treat people as if they were independent from one another.

I assume the opposite and adapt and apply cutting-edge causal inference methods to answer the question: how do the resources of one person affect the health of another?
